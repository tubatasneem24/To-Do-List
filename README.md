# Command-Line Todo List Manager

A simple **command-line Todo List Manager** built with Python.  
It allows users to add tasks, view tasks, and remove tasks from a list stored in a text file (`todos.txt`).

---

## Features

- **Add Tasks** — Quickly add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **View Tasks** — Display all current tasks with numbered indexing.
- **Remove Tasks** — Delete tasks by selecting their number.
- **Persistent Storage** — All tasks are stored in `todos.txt` and persist between sessions.

## Problem Statement
